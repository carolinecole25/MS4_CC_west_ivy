## Bugs found and fixed during development 
* Removing items from the shopping bag was not working with the below code: 
```
$('.remove-item').click(function(e) {
        var csrfToken = "{{ csrf_token }}";
        var itemId = $(this).attr('id').split('remove_')[1];
        var url = `/bag/remove/${itemId}/`;

        $.post(url, data)
         .done(function() {
             location.reload();
         });
    })
```
with the help of student support we realised I had missed off ```var data = {'csrfmiddlewaretoken': csrfToken}; ``` once this was added into the JS, the delete button worked perfectly.

## Deployment
The IDE chosen was Gitpod and deployment to Heroku.

### How to run this project locally
1. From my project's repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/carolinecole25/MS4_CC_west_ivy), download the files by clicking on "Code" and getting the zip folder.
2. Open the project's folder and install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file with the below command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
```
3 Set up your environment variables in an env.py file, ensuring you add env.py to gitignore as per below:
```
os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"
os.environ('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY')
os.environ('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
os.environ('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', 'YOUR_STRIPE_WH_SECRET')
os.environ('SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY') 
```
4. Migrate the models with the below commands in this same order:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
5. Set up the database by loading the fixtures which can be found in MS4_CC_west_ivy/products/fixtures in the following order:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories

python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
6. Create a superuser for yourself so you can do admin tasks using the below command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
7. Run the project locally with the below command:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Deployment to Heroku
1. Set up you [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) which is where your static and media files will be hosted for your deployed site.
2. Add a public access S3 basket, more informaiton [here ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html).
3. Connect this to your Django application, more information [here](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
4. Login to Heroku and create your new app and select the region closest to you.
5. In your IDE, add a Procfile with the below code:
```
web: gunicorn bojeaux.wsgi:application
```
6. In Heroku, under settings, add your Config Vars which should include the below:
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* DATABASE_URL
* SECRET_KEY
* STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
* STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
* STRIPE_WH_SECRET
* USE_AWS - set to `True`
7. In settings file, add in the below code:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-url', 'localhost']
```
8. In settings file, replace DATABASES with the below code:
```
DATABASES = {
 'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-url-goes-here')
}
```
9. Git add, commit and push code to GitHub.
10. On Heroku under the deploy tab, connect to github and choose your git repository then select auto deploy. This will take a few minutes to load, once loaded a link for your deployed site will appear. 
11. Now you can set up with your email account for sending emails. Create an email account and ensure you have 2-step verification turn and generate an App Password under settings. Add the passwork to Config Vars along with Email host pass, see below:
* EMAIL_HOST_PASS
* EMAIL_HOST_USER
10. Your site should now be deployed and functioning.
