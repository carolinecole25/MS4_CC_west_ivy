                <p>I (Caroline) was working in Buying for a retailer after studying design at university. After all things climate change, I realised environmentally conscious brandâ€™s were few and far between.</p>
                <p>The company I worked for was doing more bad than good. It was then I decided to build a planet friendly website, where individuals like myself could shop guilt-free. Nothing will contain plastic and all products will be environmentally friendly.</p>
